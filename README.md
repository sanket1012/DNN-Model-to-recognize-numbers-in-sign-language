# NN-Model-to-recognize-numbers-in-sign-lang

In this project I have build a neural network using tensorflow.  
The dataset consists of :  
*Training set*: 1080 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (180 pictures per number)  
*Test set*: 120 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (20 pictures per number)
